Back in 2014 I bought my first Raspberry Pi. At first it was only meant for tinkering. Homelab-ing, though, is like opening a bag of chips: once you start, you won't be able to stop ðŸ˜….

However Raspberry Pies aren't meant for production â€“Â I often found the RPi had destroyed the SD card, not to mention that back then they were _slow_. So I kept my RPi for tinkering and ordered an Ubuntu droplet on DigitalOcean ([use this link to get $100 in credit](https://m.do.co/c/2cd92a75e89f) ðŸ¤‘) for my production side projects and self-hosted apps.

## WIP

Needs?:

* Storage
* Compute power
* Doesn't break as often as rpi
* Others?

## My first production-grade server

HPE Microserver Gen8 + 2 x 4Tb HDDs on a RAID1 setup.

Best thing of my homelab is that it was not planned & has evolved ==> lots of learning

---

Used to run a mail server + updated the Linux kernel ==> the mail server stopped running

    Lessons learnt
      * Test on a staging env before updating prod
      * Don't run your own mail server
