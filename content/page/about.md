Hi, I'm Roger! I'm a telecom engineer ([INSA Lyon](https://www.insa-lyon.fr/) alumni) working at the [IBM Garage](https://www.ibm.com/garage) in Nice as a Cloud Software Engineer. 

## Where to find me

You can find me on [Twitter](twitter.com/roger_miret), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rogermiret) or shoot me an email at [roger@xaic.cat](mailto:roger@xaic.cat?subject=I%20Found%20Your%20Website!) in ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡© ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª (I might fallback to English if you talk to me in German ðŸ˜…).

## Hobbies @ NPOs

Over the past few years I've found that a great way to gather around people with the same interests is to join (or create!) a non-profit organization.

During INSA I joined:

* [Graines d'images](https://www.grainesdimages.fr/) â€“the school's photography associationâ€“ as a photographer
* [24 heures](https://www.24heures.org/) â€“a music festival & bike raceâ€“ for the association's CIO department

On my 3rd year, a friend made me discover hackathons. We went to Junction together ([won a 2nd prize](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rogermiret_junction2019-activity-6472854637660696577-6Xp4) ðŸŽ‰). The whole experience inspired me to:

* Create [HackLyon](https://hacklyon.com) with a bunch of friends
* Join [Junction](https://www.hackjunction.com/) as an organizer during my Erasmus semester in Helsinki
